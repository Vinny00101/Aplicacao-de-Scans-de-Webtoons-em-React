<h1 align="center">Blue Scan</h1>
<h2 align="center">React + Vite</h2>

This is an application made in React for a webtoons scans site, with front-end and back-end integration. Currently, the application is under development. The back-end will possibly be presented in another repository and is being developed using Node.js and Express with MySQL.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
